      Medicare is a government national health insurance program in the United States, begun in 1965 under the Social
      Security Administration (SSA) and now administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). It
      primarily provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older, but also for some younger people with
      disability status as determined by the SSA, including people with end stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease).

      In 2018, according to the 2019 Medicare Trustees Report, Medicare provided health insurance for over 59.9 million
      individualsâ€”more than 52 million people aged 65 and older and about 8 million younger people.[1] According to
      annual Medicare Trustees reports and research by the government's MedPAC group, Medicare covers about half of
      healthcare expenses of those enrolled. Enrollees almost always cover most of the remaining costs by taking
      additional private insurance and/or by joining a public Part C or Part D Medicare health plan.[2] In 2020, US
      federal government spending on Medicare was $776.2 billion.[3]
